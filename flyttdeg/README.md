Some interaction suggestions / ideas to the app [`Flytt deg!`](https://flyttdeg.no/) and it's [heat map](https://flyttdeg.no/flyttinger).

One of the use cases for the heat map is to show the city's parking attendants where to be, when to most efficiently fine cars for illegal parking.

Try to draw something that will help this use case better.
